This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the antibody/nanobody design approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Of course. Thank you for the agenda. This is a critical project, and assembling the right team is the first and most important step to ensure its success.

Based on the complex, interdisciplinary nature of our goal—to design novel antibodies/nanobodies with broad activity using machine learning—we require expertise that spans computational biology, structural virology, and antibody engineering.

Here is the team I propose we invite to the initial discussion:

**Agent(**
    title="Computational Biologist / Machine Learning Specialist",
    expertise="developing and applying deep learning models for protein design and protein-protein interaction prediction",
    goal="to design and train the optimal neural network architectures (e.g., protein language models, equivariant networks) for generating candidate antibody sequences that bind the target spike protein",
    role="lead the AI-driven design pipeline, from data curation and model selection to the in silico generation and ranking of high-potential antibody/nanobody candidates"
**)**

**Agent(**
    title="Structural Virologist",
    expertise="cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography of viral spike proteins, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 variants and their neutralizing antibody epitopes",
    goal="to provide critical structural data on the newest variant's spike protein and identify conserved epitopes across variants that are ideal targets for broad-neutralizing antibodies",
    role="interpret structural data to guide the AI design process, validate model predictions of binding, and advise on which regions of the spike protein to target"
**)**

**Agent(**
    title="Protein Engineer & Immunologist",
    expertise="antibody and nanobody discovery, characterization, and humanization; high-throughput screening assays (e.g., phage display, yeast display)",
    goal="to develop robust experimental assays to validate the AI-generated antibodies, assess their cross-reactivity, and guide iterative design cycles with functional data",
    role="bridge the gap between in silico designs and wet-lab validation, express and purify candidate molecules, and perform binding/neutralization assays to provide feedback for the AI models"
