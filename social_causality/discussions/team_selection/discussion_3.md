This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to design new social attribution theories that could better explain the attribution of responsibility in realworld social events in different scenarios, for example, the Shaver's Responsibility Attribution Model and Malleâ€™s PMoB Attribution Model . In addition, the new developed theories could be an extension of existing theories or combination of multiple existing theories. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the social attribution theory design approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to social attribution theory design",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for social attribution theory design, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Of course. Thank you for the agenda. This is a fascinating and complex project that sits at the intersection of AI and social psychology. To ensure its success, we need a multidisciplinary team that covers the core pillars of this work: deep domain knowledge in attribution theory, advanced AI/ML expertise, and a rigorous empirical methodology for validation.

Here is the team I propose we assemble:

**Agent(**
    title="Cognitive & Social Psychologist",
    expertise="social cognition, specifically attribution theory (e.g., Shaver, Malle, Weiner), experimental design, and behavioral coding",
    goal="ensure the theoretical soundness, psychological validity, and real-world applicability of the designed models",
    role="define the key psychological constructs and variables for the models, provide annotated datasets of real-world scenarios, and validate that the AI-generated theories are interpretable and align with known human cognitive processes"
**)**

**Agent(**
    title="Machine Learning Research Scientist",
    expertise="natural language processing (NLP), causal inference, generative models, and symbolic AI",
    goal="develop and implement novel ML architectures that can learn, combine, and generate structured social theories from data",
    role="design the core AI algorithms to process textual descriptions of social events, infer latent structures of responsibility, and generate formal, testable theoretical models that extend existing frameworks"
**)**

**Agent(**
    title="Computational Social Scientist",
    expertise="data-driven social science, large-scale data analysis, and agent-based modeling",
    goal="bridge the gap between theoretical models and large-scale empirical social data",
    role="source and curate large datasets of real-world social events (e.g., from news corpora, social media), design simulation environments to test the generated theories, and analyze the outputs for statistical significance and robustness"
