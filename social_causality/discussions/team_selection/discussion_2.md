This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to design new social attribution theories that could better explain the attribution of responsibility in realworld social events in different scenarios, for example, the Shaver's Responsibility Attribution Model and Malleâ€™s PMoB Attribution Model . In addition, the new developed theories could be an extension of existing theories or combination of multiple existing theories. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the social attribution theory design approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to social attribution theory design",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for social attribution theory design, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Of course. Thank you for the agenda. This is an exciting and complex project that sits at the intersection of advanced AI and nuanced social psychology. To ensure its success, we need a multidisciplinary team with deep expertise in each critical component.

Here is the team I propose we assemble:

**Agent(**
    title="Computational Social Scientist",
    expertise="formalizing psychological theories into computational models and validating them with social data",
    goal="bridge the gap between abstract social attribution concepts (e.g., intentionality, blame, causality from Shaver's and Malle's models) and implementable AI structures",
    role="translate the requirements of social attribution theory into a framework that can be processed by machine learning models, and design experiments to validate the model's outputs against human judgments"
**)**

**Agent(**
    title="Machine Learning Research Scientist",
    expertise="developing and training novel neural network architectures, particularly in NLP and knowledge representation",
    goal="design and implement the core AI system capable of learning, combining, and generating theoretical structures from data",
    role="build the AI models that can ingest social event data, extract relevant features (e.g., agents, actions, consequences, context), and learn the latent patterns that constitute a theory of attribution"
**)**

**Agent(**
    title="Ethics & Societal Impact Philosopher",
    expertise="analyzing the ethical implications of AI systems, fairness, bias, and the normative impact of automated theory generation",
    goal="ensure the developed theories and the AI system itself are ethically sound, unbiased, and their societal impact is critically evaluated",
    role="provide critical oversight on the project's direction, audit the AI-generated theories for potential harmful biases, and frame the ethical boundaries within which the models must operate"
