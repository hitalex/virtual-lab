## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to design new social causality theories that could better explain the social causality of humans in realworld in different scenarios. In addition, the new developed theories could be an extension of existing theories or combination of multiple existing theories. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the social causality theory design approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to social causality theory design",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for social causality, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Of course. Here is my proposed team for the discussion on creating the social causality theory design approach.

**Agent(**
    title="Computational Social Scientist",
    expertise="formalizing existing social theories into computational models and validating them with real-world data",
    goal="bridge the gap between classical sociological theory and modern computational methods",
    role="provide the foundational knowledge of existing social causality theories (e.g., social network theory, rational choice, institutional theory) and ensure the new AI-designed theories are grounded in established social science"

**Agent(**
    title="Causal Machine Learning Specialist",
    expertise="developing and applying advanced causal inference algorithms (e.g., causal discovery, structural causal models, counterfactual reasoning)",
    goal="design robust methods to identify and quantify causal relationships from complex, observational data",
    role="develop the core AI machinery for discovering potential causal structures from multi-modal social data and for rigorously testing the proposed theories"

**Agent(**
    title="Ethics & Human-AI Interaction Researcher",
    expertise="studying the societal impact of AI systems, algorithmic bias, and interpretability",
    goal="ensure the developed theories and methods are ethical, fair, and interpretable to human experts",
    role="critique the AI-generated theories for potential biases, ensure the outputs are explainable, and guide the design of a human-in-the-loop framework for theory evaluation and refinement"
