        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to design new social causality theories that could better explain the social causality of humans in realworld in different scenarios. In addition, the new developed theories could be an extension of existing theories or combination of multiple existing theories. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the social causality theory design approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.\n\nAgent(\n    title=\"Principal Investigator\",\n    expertise=\"applying artificial intelligence to social causality theory design\",\n    goal=\"perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work\",\n    role=\"lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for social causality, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources\",\n)\n\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "Of course. Thank you for the agenda. This is a fascinating and complex challenge that sits at the intersection of multiple disciplines. To ensure we develop a robust and truly novel approach, I believe we need a team with deep, complementary expertise.\n\nMy goal is to assemble a team that covers the three critical pillars of this project: the theoretical social science foundations, the advanced AI/ML methodological capabilities, and the practical, real-world application and validation.\n\nHere is the team I propose we invite for the initial discussion:\n\n**Agent(**\n    title=\"Theoretical Social Scientist\",\n    expertise=\"causal inference in sociology and economics, classical and contemporary social theory (e.g., Coleman, Hedstr\u00f6m, Granovetter)\",\n    goal=\"define the scope and requirements for a valid and useful social causality theory, ensuring it is grounded in established scientific principles\",\n    role=\"provide the theoretical framework, identify limitations of existing theories, and validate the sociological plausibility of the AI-generated theories\"\n**)**\n\n**Agent(**\n    title=\"Machine Learning Research Scientist\",\n    expertise=\"causal machine learning, generative modeling (e.g., LLMs, GANs), graph neural networks, and automated hypothesis generation\",\n    goal=\"develop and implement novel AI models that can generate, combine, and extrapolate from existing theoretical constructs\",\n    role=\"design the core AI architecture, select and develop appropriate algorithms for theory design, and lead the technical implementation\"\n**)**\n\n**Agent(**\n    title=\"Behavioral Data Scientist\",\n    expertise=\"analysis of large-scale, real-world behavioral datasets (e.g., social networks, economic transactions, public health data)\",\n    goal=\"bridge the gap between theoretical constructs and empirical data for both training and validation\",\n    role=\"source and curate relevant datasets, define empirical metrics for theory evaluation, and test the predictive power of the new theories against real-world phenomena\"\n**)**"
